            A housing choice voucher provides the recipient greater freedom as
            to where to live, but also forces them to make a choice on where
            will be best to suit their current needs. The Cleveland Housing
            Hackathon has highlighted transportation, education, wellness, and
            connectivity as contributing factors in the decision where to live.

      <center><h4>Cleveland Housing Hackathon Problem Statements</h4></center>

          <p>
             How can we better illustrate well-resourced areas, in order to
             help HCVP recipients find properties and increase mobility? We
             invite you develop a creative solution for one or more of the
             following problem statements:
           </p>



        <div class="row">
  <div class="col s12">
    <ul class="tabs">
      <li class="tab col s3"><a class="active"  href="#test1">Transportation</a></li>
      <li class="tab col s3"><a href="#test2">Education</a></li>
      <li class="tab col s3 "><a href="#test3">Wellness</a></li>
      <li class="tab col s3"><a href="#test4">Connectivity</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="test1" class="col s12">
    <p> Ease of transportation serves as
    one of the biggest concerns in a household’s decision on where to
    live. According to the Brookings Institution, the Cleveland
    metropolitan area experienced a 27% decrease in the number of jobs
    near the average resident between 2000 and 2012. High poverty
    areas within the Cleveland metropolitan area had a 35% decrease in
    the number of jobs near the average resident. Both figures ranked
    first among the top 96 United States metropolitan statistical
    areas. Cuyahoga County has always made public transportation a
    priority for its residents, as shown in projects like the GCTRA’s
    Healthline BRT, but it is imperative that we examine the evolving
    needs of our residents. <strong>How do we evaluate the accessibility of
    well-resourced neighborhoods, in order to increase the mobility of
    low income households who do not have a personal vehicle?</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div id="test2" class="col s12">
    <p> Education is one of the strongest
    factors in determining social mobility. The quality of a child’s
    education holds a direct correlation to life success, starting
    from preschool. This foundation continues to build throughout
    adolescence. The knowledge gained while young helps each child to
    develop academic interests, while extracurricular activities can
    have a positive impact on student engagement. <strong>How can we help
    families by ensuring that they have the opportunity to send their
    children to schools with the best educational resources to serve
    their individual needs?</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div id="test3" class="col s12">
    <p> Wellness is an often overlooked, yet
    essential, aspect to housing mobility. A neighborhood only becomes
    a thriving community when it is able to provide the resources that
    their residents need. Safe, well lit, neighborhoods create a sense
    of comfort and can transform an area’s identity. Healthy, fresh,
    food choices provide inhabitants with cost effective options for
    nourishment. Social spaces, such as community centers and
    churches, help people build relationships in new surroundings.<strong> How
    can we help people determine that a neighborhood will provide the
    amenities that new members require in order to thrive, no matter
    their demographic, and become a long lasting asset to the
    community?</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div id="test4" class="col s12">
    <p> In today’s day and age, high speed
    internet is all but a necessity. The internet provides users of
    all ages with access to a wealth of information and opportunities.
    Unfortunately, high speed internet is considered a luxury to a
    significant portion of Cuyahoga County residents. Results of a
    2012 survey show that approximately 58% of county households with
    an annual income below $20,000 have neither home broadband nor
    mobile internet access. With 24% of Cuyahoga County’s households
    falling in that income range, this leaves about 75,000 households
    at a severe disadvantage. Lack of computer and high speed internet
    access makes it more difficult for children to do their homework,
    adults to find jobs, and a lack of familiarity with computers
    prevents them from gaining the competency necessary to take
    advantage of new opportunities in our evolving economy. <strong> How do we
    evaluate neighborhoods for high speed internet connectivity, and
    computer access, in order to ensure that households move to areas
    that provide them with the technological resources necessary to
    achieve their goals? </strong></p>
