            A housing choice voucher provides the recipient greater freedom as
            to where to live, but also forces them to make a choice on where
            will be best to suit their current needs. The Cleveland Housing
            Hackathon has highlighted transportation, education, wellness, and
            connectivity as contributing factors in the decision where to live.

              How can we better illustrate well-resourced areas, in order to
              help HCVP recipients find properties and increase mobility? We
              invite you develop a creative solution for one or more of the
              following problem statements:
            </p>


            <p>
              <strong>Transportation</strong> Ease of transportation serves as
              one of the biggest concerns in a household’s decision on where to
              live. According to the Brookings Institution, the Cleveland
              metropolitan area experienced a 27% decrease in the number of jobs
              near the average resident between 2000 and 2012. High poverty
              areas within the Cleveland metropolitan area had a 35% decrease in
              the number of jobs near the average resident. Both figures ranked
              first among the top 96 United States metropolitan statistical
              areas. Cuyahoga County has always made public transportation a
              priority for its residents, as shown in projects like the GCTRA’s
              Healthline BRT, but it is imperative that we examine the evolving
              needs of our residents. <strong>How do we evaluate the accessibility of
              well-resourced neighborhoods, in order to increase the mobility of
              low income households who do not have a personal vehicle?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Education</strong> Education is one of the strongest
              factors in determining social mobility. The quality of a child’s
              education holds a direct correlation to life success, starting
              from preschool. This foundation continues to build throughout
              adolescence. The knowledge gained while young helps each child to
              develop academic interests, while extracurricular activities can
              have a positive impact on student engagement. <strong>How can we help
              families by ensuring that they have the opportunity to send their
              children to schools with the best educational resources to serve
              their individual needs?</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col l6">
            <p>
              <strong>Wellness</strong> Wellness is an often overlooked, yet
              essential, aspect to housing mobility. A neighborhood only becomes
              a thriving community when it is able to provide the resources that
              their residents need. Safe, well lit, neighborhoods create a sense
              of comfort and can transform an area’s identity. Healthy, fresh,
              food choices provide inhabitants with cost effective options for
              nourishment. Social spaces, such as community centers and
              churches, help people build relationships in new surroundings.<strong> How
              can we help people determine that a neighborhood will provide the
              amenities that new members require in order to thrive, no matter
              their demographic, and become a long lasting asset to the
              community?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Connectivity</strong> In today’s day and age, high speed
              internet is all but a necessity. The internet provides users of
              all ages with access to a wealth of information and opportunities.
              Unfortunately, high speed internet is considered a luxury to a
              significant portion of Cuyahoga County residents. Results of a
              2012 survey show that approximately 58% of county households with
              an annual income below $20,000 have neither home broadband nor
              mobile internet access. With 24% of Cuyahoga County’s households
              falling in that income range, this leaves about 75,000 households
              at a severe disadvantage. Lack of computer and high speed internet
              access makes it more difficult for children to do their homework,
              adults to find jobs, and a lack of familiarity with computers
              prevents them from gaining the competency necessary to take
              advantage of new opportunities in our evolving economy. <strong> How do we
              evaluate neighborhoods for high speed internet connectivity, and
              computer access, in order to ensure that households move to areas
              that provide them with the technological resources necessary to
              achieve their goals? </strong>
