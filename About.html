        <p>
          The federal government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development
          (HUD) operates three major programs for assisting low-income
          households in securing housing: public housing, Section 8
          Project-Based Rental Assistance, and the Section 8 Housing Choice
          Voucher (HCV) program. While the former two programs are place-based,
          in that they are linked to physical structures that qualified
          individuals and families can reside in, the latter program is
          people-based. It endows eligible recipients with the monetary means—a
          voucher—to secure housing in the private market.

        <p>The HCV program is the largest subsidized-housing program operated by
          the federal government. It provides funding to locally based housing
          authorities to allocate vouchers to income-eligible residents so they can
          rent apartments or houses owned by private (i.e., non-governmental)
          parties. This “free-market” approach empowers voucher recipients to live
          anywhere within the service area of the housing authority. In general,
          people receiving these vouchers must pay 30 percent of their adjusted
          gross income toward rent, a share that affordable housing proponents
          generally regard as the maximum percentage a household should spend on
          housing, and the public housing authority (PHA) pays the rest.

        The Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) is the housing agency
        that administers the HCV Program in Cuyahoga County. A person selected to
        participate in HCV Program is issued a rental voucher, and is then free to
        locate a dwelling unit suitable to the family's needs and desires in the
        private rental market. Once the unit passes the HUD housing quality
        standards (HQS) inspection, CMHA will enter into a Housing Assistance
        Payment (HAP) Contract with the Owner who leases the unit to the family.
        Thereafter, CMHA pays a portion of the rent - a housing assistance payment
        - to the owner on behalf of the family, while the voucher recipient pays
        remaining balance of the agreed upon rent.
